# K-FOSS/TS-ESTests

This is a lightweight testing framework for use with ESNext & ESModules code. Orignally created within my [@K-FOSS/TS-ESNode](https://github.com/K-FOSS/TS-ESNode) repo for testing.


## Development

This is designed to be developed within a VSCode Remote Container. When you open is VSCode you should get a notification prompting to reopen in container.
